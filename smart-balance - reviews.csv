9,Easy to use and one of my favorite butter spreads. I highly recommend it for cooking and for baking purposes. I like this better compared to other brands of butter because it’s not as greasy or upset my stomach as much.,influenster
10,So glad to have this available as an alternative to butter as my husband is highly allergic to dairy. It works for baking just like real butter and has a great taste even just on toast. The only draw back is the high priced point.,influenster
11,I got this once and I fell in love with it. It’s creamy and buttery but I love that’s it’s gmo free. I would definitely recommend it. This is now the only butter I buy.,influenster
12,Smart balance is the only butter I will buy. The flavor and health benefits top any other butter I have tried. This butter actually tastes GOOD. If you haven’t tried it you are missing out!!! Totally worth the extra money hands down!!,influenster
13,"This is my favorite butter for anything and everything. I have been using this butter ever since childhood. I love the taste, it’s very smooth, and extremely easy to spread. I use it with food from toast to pasta.",influenster
14,smart balance buttery spread is great for slender like me because it tastes exactly like butter but has no dairy in it. i’m allergic to dairy so this is the best alternative,influenster
15,This product has a light flavor and I use on whole wheat toast or on cooked veggies. I use it weekly and I plan to purchase it again.,influenster

17,This is one of my favorite butters. It’s smooth and creamy and tastes absolutely amazing.,influenster
18,"This butter has been a lifesaver, my husband is lactose intolerant and for so long I was unable to make anything that used butter because of his allergy until we found this one. It has the same buttery taste while eliminating the lactose so he can enjoy",influenster
19,"This butter helps you keep your good cholesterol levels in check. It has 60% less saturated fat than regular butter, and it tastes great. It also has beneficial Omega oils. Great option if you need butter but not all the negative effects regular butter has.",influenster
20,"Honestly why keep on using butter when this is such a perfect alternative! I’ve always used this alternative butter and honestly it does taste like butter. I use it to cook or to spread on toast. Since I can’t eat dairy and have to be on a low cholesterol diet, this is just for me and many of you guys!",influenster
21,"As far as spreadable butter or vegetable oil products, this is number one in my book. Not only is it more healthy for you than butter, but it tastes exactly like butter to me. The only thing I don't use it for is baking. So I don't know how well it works there. But for everything else, it works beautifully, is very spreadable, and is much healthier for you than regular butter. My dad has heart disease issues and has used to this for years after a recommendation from his doctor.",influenster
22,"Seriously the best tasting ""butter"" ever. And it's good for you and doesn't contain a bunch of junk like other none butters.",influenster
23,"This is my personal go-to for a butter substitute. It has a good amount of flavor without the heavy feeling of real butter. It works well for cooking, baking, and spreading. I think it tastes great and works well for a variety of uses while being a healthier choice. I've been using it for a while now and will continue to use it",influenster
24,"Wasn't found of this, it wasn't that great. Didn't have a good texture and tasted really oily! Wouldn't buy it again.",influenster
25,"This is definitely the best tasting butter Ive tried. Im very picky about the flavor/texture of butter but this one is great. The price is a little higher than other butter but the flavor surely makes it worth it. If you're looking for something new to try, please give this a shot!",influenster
26,Smart Balance is overall a great alternative to butter if you are watching your fat intake. This still has a decent amount of fat but the overall contents seem to be a bit healthier than real butter. The taste is great as well and I usually get this instead.,influenster
27,I use this and I find it to be much healthy than reg butter. I can honestly say I am please the the price is good. I have bought this twice.So therefore I am a repeat customer. The flavor is tasty.,influenster
28,This is so good! It's so much more healthier than lard or real butter and it tastes just as good,influenster
29,"This is an excellent replacement for regular, not-so-healthy butter. I used to love butter and put it on and in about everything I ate and cooked, knowing it was not good for me. Now I put Smart Balance on and in everything. Everything tastes great... and NO guilt!",influenster
30,"My grandmother uses smart balance religiously and if she wouldn't have told me it ""wasn't bad for me butter"" I wouldn't have known the difference..it's very good and can go everything butter can! And it has no GMO's... #addedPLUS!",influenster
31,"Great alternative to regular fatty butter. This is flavorful healthy!, and no GMO! A combo that you don't hear often! I spread this on toast for breakfast everyday guilt free!",influenster
32,"A perfect butter with no GMO's so you know you're getting good quality, has natural ingredients that you know you can trust. Must buy",influenster
33,If you're trying to watch what you eat and stay on a healthy diet i definitely recommend purchasing this product. good taste.,influenster
34,"Health benefits are good but, (unless I got a bad batch) it's just plain gross. It's so bad I'm throwing away a barely used tub, gave it 2-3 chances but no, can't do it.",amazon
35,Nice to used and happy Belly,amazon
36,Love it,amazon
37,"Good taste, even my family & friends love it!",amazon
38,"I due apologize for long rating wait but unfortunately, I unable to submit a long review for this listed item I purchased. but it came on time. wasn't damaged. this is a good seller. yea I have over a hundred items to rate so I have to keep it short. love the item",amazon
39,"I am usually one of these people that say if you want butter eat the real thing. But wanted to stay a little more conscientious of my cholesterol intake I decided to give this a try after reading some reviews and while I’m blown away I sprayed it on one piece of toast and took a bite and Yum it’s delicious and it fooled me. It’s a good alternative with great taste I recommend it. I have tried other substitute butter brands in the past at parties and other places but this has to be the best one hands-down. I like the olive oil version. it’s good for spreading on toast, pancakes and adding some flavor to sauces but I probably wouldn’t use it for baking.",amazon
40,"I have bought this product for years. However they seemed recently to change the product to make it softer and easier to spread. Upon doing this , the flavor changed. There is an odd taste I have noticed since this change. I prefer the old flavor. I’m still using it because of the healthy benefits it provides but may try other products for a nicer flavor. I hope they catch this problem and remedy it in the future.",amazon
41,I like butter alternatives but margarine is blah. I would give it 5 stars but since this is second in flavor to Olivio light then it is 4 stars.,amazon
42,New formulation does not harden as well as original. Actually liquid around edges of container. Taste seems off too. Will NOT buy again!!,amazon
43,I didn't want to take a statin so I started using Smart Balance instead of butter and yogurt butter just over a year ago. I didn't change my diet except for using Olive Oil in place of vegetable oil and my cholesterol is down 28 points. I actually prefer the taste of all of the Smart Balance butter spreads to real butter which now tastes bland and greasy to me. There is a website complaining about this product being bad for you and claiming butter is healthier even though it has twice the calories and more than twice the fat. I like all three of the Smart Balance products and my husband and I have both seen our good cholesterol go up and the bad go down in just about a year. Liking the taste is a bonus!,amazon
44,This is what we always buy. I’m trying Amazon now. Hopefully everything is ok with it. It looks ok. But I forgot to check the expiration date on it. I’ll see later and update this.,amazon
45,Love it,amazon
46,I have bought this for many years and now it is like diet margarine. The first ingredient on the label now is water and it tastes terrible. Please bring back the old Smart Balance Olive Oil Spread as I won't be buying this one anymore. I have to check on their website and see if they changed the original spread too as I like that one also and if they have then I won't buy either anymore. Edited to add on 11-29-22: Now the water is making pools in the container that I have to pour out before using. I am only using it on untoasted white bread to eat with a meal as it isn't good for anything else and barely this.,amazon
47,"I bought this by mistake and put it in the trash. This tastes like the fake butter powder they put on popcorn at cheap movie theaters. Chock full of cheap oils, emulsifiers and artificial flavors.",amazon
48,Beat of all the margarine products out there. It's healthy and tastes great! It's the only spread we'll use in our house.,amazon
49,This USED to be a good product. I recently bought more and noticed it seemed more whipped. I then attempted to use to make grilled cheese. There was so much water beaded up in the pan it ruined the food. Tried again with grilling something else in a pan and it still had so much water. Sub par product. Too bad they messed around with the water.,amazon
50,"It has just the right amount of salt, very easy to spread, good flavor and healthy",amazon
51,Delicious for a healthier type of butter. Cholesterol friendly.,amazon
52,I liked it but the taste wasn’t the best... I like to put butter on my toast so I tasted it and I didn’t fall in love but we finished it as a family and appreciated having vegan buttery spread,amazon

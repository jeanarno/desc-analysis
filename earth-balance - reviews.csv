2,"Flavor, multiple uses in cooking.",amazon
3,Love this product easy to spread,amazon
4,"We have ordered this flavorful salted spread many times. Good flavor, spreads fairly smoothly, excellent on baked potatoes & added bonus, great to use in frying pan for sautéing.",amazon
5, If your a plant-based chef you need this in your arsenal. It works wonders.,amazon
6,"My mother always cooked and baked with butter. I remember many Sunday dinners that included flaky, buttery biscuits, spread with real butter. I love the taste of butter, but I've now been a vegetarian for decades, and I'm not going to put butter, which, though delicious, is loaded with saturated and trans fats, into my body. I love Earth Balance because it's vegan, and it doesn't contain all the unhealthy fats that real butter does. But, it tastes like real butter! As someone who grew up with real butter spread on her morning English muffins, on her afternoon toast, on her Sunday biscuits and cornbread, etc., I do know the taste of butter when I encounter it. I didn't like the taste of many of the ""healthy"" margarines I was buying, but Earth Balance gives me that wonderful buttery taste along with omega-3s, and no GMOs or preservatives. It's butter that's actually good for me! And, as an added bonus, I can cook with it and bake with it in addition to spreading it on my morning English muffin. To me, that's like ""having my butter and eating it, too!"" The original is the only formulation I've tried, but I have no doubt that I'll love the others just as much. This spreads easily, and because it is healthy and plant-based, I can spread it on a little more thickly than I used to spread on margarine. And my childhood taught me not to spare the butter! This will be my go-to brand as long as it's available. If you like butter, I think you're going to love Earth Balance.",amazon
7,Have use this product for awhile.,amazon
8,Fantastic taste! Super easy to spread.,amazon
9,"Doesn’t spread well unless softened so I always use a hot utensil for it. Pricey too but worth it, I suppose.",amazon
10,"I'm a butter person, however when going on the Daniel fast, I could not have any dairy. The Earth Balance spread is as close to butter as I have ever found. I highly recommend it.",amazon
11,"I like the brand. But the organic butter tastes better. I'm not sure why but this one leaves a bit of a weird aftertaste. I love all types of butter and the organic one tastes the most similar to the real thing. If I had to pick don't get the original, get the organic.",amazon
12,"Does not taste like butter, but haven’t come across a better vegan butter yet - though, honestly, this is the first vegan butter i’ve tried. what this does taste like is an oily mouthful of salt. in a way it tastes like the stuff they squirt on your popcorn in a theatre. which, personally, i find gross and always take a pass on. no thanks (shudder). but if you love that mouthful of salt and oil, and think of it as ‘butter’, then you might like this. personally, i think of butter as a rich creamy experience. and, the way they present it in the container, it looks like you might get that. but, you don’t. i’m a vegetarian, not a vegan, and will likely stick with butter from organic pasture raised cows. i’m good with those ethics and there’s nothing like the real deal, at least as far as i can tell. however, i bought the butter substitute because i’m making cornbread for a vegan thanksgiving, and i can’t imagine serving cornbread w/o butter. or something kind of like it. and this item had a lot of positive reviews, so i figured it would be good. i don’t think it’s good - at all. but giving it 3 stars because it’ll do, and i can see how other people who think of the theatre popcorn topping as butter might be similarly inclined to think of this that way. kind of a shame, really. anyway, if your thinking of baking with this , definitely don’t! it’s extremely salty and will ruin cookies, etc that rely on unsalted butter. (i know you already figured that out)",amazon
13,"Since childhood I have been hooked on to Indian made Amul butter. I have tried many different butter brands here in America but none of them come close of Amul butter. But since I am adopting veganism, I cannot indulge myself with real butter anymore. In comes Earth Balance. This spread's flavor and texture is so similar to Amul butter. I have tried few vegan butters but this is by far the best. I have used it on sandwiches, baking a vegan cake, several Indian dishes and it tastes amazing, highly recommended!",amazon
14,Highly recommend to anyone wanted to cut out butter or dairy. Very tasty.,amazon
15,What's not to like?? This gives a very nice flavor to just about everything you put it on. I also melt it for use in pancakes and cakes and use it to fry things.,amazon
16,"In my opinion, this is the best tasting margarine/plant based spread. I've happily used it for years. It spreads easily too.",amazon
17,Good taste but it is a little hard to spread.,amazon
18,"Favorite replacement for the butter I used to use, it not easy to spread on so I do recommend letting it sit out for a little before using. I usually sit it by my oven to let the heat travel to the container to get it to soften up before using.",amazon
19,"Excellent on vegetables, baked potatoes, toast, pancakes, and crackers. Taste buttery and light. Use for baking and frying.",amazon
20,Highly recommend it. Easy decision for me because it’s cruelty free and tastes great! Everyone in my family loves it.,amazon
21,This stuff is hard as a rock. The taste is nothing to be proud of too.,amazon
22,"100% vegan. I have Alpha-gal Syndrome and experience anaphylactic shock if I ingest or are exposed to mammal. 100% vegan and melts and spreads like ""real"" butter. I fooled my dairy-fan Daddy and my vegetarian butter loving son with this one!",amazon
23,So buttery and delicious! Much better than dairy butter.,amazon
24,"We purchased this when my husband was doing an elimination diet to find out the source of some issues he was having. We both love it, and keep buying it, even though dairy was determined not to be the issue.",amazon
25,I use the Earth Balance to make my peanut butter sandwiches. I spread a thick layer on each of the whole wheat bread pieces that I use. Then I put on a thick layer of peanut butter. Quite delicious!!!,amazon
26,If you miss butter you won’t anymore,amazon
27,I recently went vegan and the one thing I really missed was butter. I tried several replacements and they just didn't cut it. Then I found this. It has a great texture and flavor and has satisfied my butter craving. Works wonderfully on my steamed vegetables.,amazon
28,Earth Balance spread has a good taste like butter. For the last few years have been purchasing this brand from Whole foods and other stores that sell it. Price is good. Wish it came in larger tub.,amazon

34,"Just like butter.....the one and only difference is texture its more closely ressembles margarine and because of that u can use less an will last u a lil longer. I gave it a try and very satisfied, i promise it wont throw u for a loop.",amazon
35,"This tastes just like country crock. Worth it. The only things that’s different is consistency, it’s a little firmer but barely.",amazon
36,Delicious. Tastes like real scrambled eggs. Easy to prepare. No messy egg shells and best of all no cholesterol.,amazon
37,"Only thing that could make it better is to bring back the 45 oz bulk earth balance! We love this in baking, popcorn, toast, making vegan caramel, you name it! Truly an amazing sub for butter!",amazon
38,"For this butter being dairy free and gluten free, I must say, taste like the real thing. Real damn close.",amazon
39,Not sure what real butter tastes like since I’m allergic to dairy but this is delicious. It’s the only vegan butter I use in cooking and my non-vegan husband likes it too!,amazon
40,"It’s butter. It’s vegan. It’s vegan butter. I’m happy. Also, it doesn’t contain a lot of water like other brands do, so it doesn’t burn off quick when using to fry food. I have used this brand for over 10 years and love it.",amazon
41,"For someone who loves butter this was a very nice surprise as I’m trying to give up dairy, tastes great to me and will continue to buy",amazon

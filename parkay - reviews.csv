3,The best butter ever but it’s so hard to find in my hometown now. Like it’s perfect. I love the taste it gives. I just wish I could find the tube.,influenster
4,Parkay doesn't have the nicest taste it better for baking and cooking butter. It's cheap compared to together brands which is why it lacks in quality. I would recommend this product to families on a budget or big families. I'd recommend to try it out worth it because its cheap,influenster

18,"I been looking everywhere in the super markets for this item... I believe this is the same item the corn man uses to put on the corn... one thing to know , it’s a little runny , so be careful cause it comes out fast",amazon
19,"Perfect for adding to toast with minimal effort, and easy to add to recipes on the stove. Has same flavor as other forms of Parkey, and it's a mild flavor I like. A tad expensive, however, but if it fits your needs, it's worth it.",amazon
20,"Arrived to me sealed and in good condition, but according to the printed expiration date, I had only a month to consume the entire bottle before going bad. Maybe that’s normal for Parkay, but I’d assume margarine spread has a much longer shelf life than that.",amazon
21,Made Homemade Mexican Elotes and this was exactly what I needed to drizzle on top. Highly reccomend.,amazon
22,This butter is terrible tasting and it is so runny that is almost like water when poured. It isn't spreadable either because it absorbs into whatever you put it on before you can taste it. I thought it would work well in gravy mixes but the taste is terrible,amazon

44,"Absolutely dreadful. Purely chemical suspended in low-quality hydrogenated oils. Tastes like nothing found in nature. And yet. This is the flavor of childhood to me. The only sauce I would allow over my austere plain cooked pasta. It just happens to be accidentally vegan, but no, by no stretch of the imagination could you call it health food. Buy it for the nostalgia, not for the nutrition.",amazon
45,its great taste,amazon
46,"Anyone dumb enough in this day and age to believe margarine is healthy deserves the inevitable heart disease they'll get. This stuff is full of trans-fats and processed oils that have no resemblance to the actual oils listed. I was raised on margarine and skim milk (""fat is bad!""--remember that campaign?). My jaw was consequently malformed (too small for 8 molars, which had to be pulled--sound familiar, anyone who had wisdom teeth removed?), and my nasal passages are too small to breathe through. I have two hernias, because I didn't get healthy fats full of vitamins A, D, E, and K so my connective tissue didn't develop properly. Get with the program, people. Buy raw milk, and eat raw butter and cod liver oil. It'll change your health dramatically if you're deficient in fat-soluble vitamins. Which, if you're looking at this garbage food, you are. Stop buying these processed foods that are killing all of us.",amazon
47,It contains trans fat and is bad for your health.,amazon
48,"Delicious, light and creamy. No cholesterol. Not appropriate for both of my parents. On a retromercial during its initial contract, 1973-1985, it went ""butter""!",amazon
49,Tastes like Parkey squeezable butter...what more is there to say? It was fresh and packaged well?,amazon
50,My favorite margarine! It's the best on the market! I use it always in my choc chip cookies and on my vegetables. I use the tub of soft Parkay on my toast. It's just the best!!!,walmart
51,"I have used Parkay for years and love the taste. I use the tub for toast, waffles, etc. and cubes for frying and cooking. I have tried other brands and have always come back to Parkay.",walmart
52,"Have used Parkay, not sure the recipe is the same but still think it is my favorite for stick margarine.",walmart

1,I have used blue bonnet off and on for years. Great price but not the best taste. Product has been around for years.,influenster
2,We purchased the Blue Bonnet butter recently. We use it for cooking mainly. It has a good and natural taste- it tastes really good on toast too. The price point is on target and it’s good amongst its competitors. I do recommend it!,influenster
3,"I use this product on and in certain dishes, and on toast or bagels, its good and in comparison with parkay I like it better, would not improve this product its affordable and cost around 2.00 to 3.00, I am very satisfied with this and I will continue using it I do recommend this product",influenster
4,"I just wanna know, who don't like Blue Bonnet? Other than it being creamy and making your grilled cheese a golden brown, and french toast, baked potatoes, quesadillas...endless possibilities.",influenster
5,I love blue bonnet vegetable oil spread as a healthier AND tastier alternative to butter or margarine.,influenster
6,Blue bonnet is a great brand. I use it to cook veggies and meat. It is easy to spread on toast. Has no hydrogenated oil. We use to use country crock butter until we seen a huge difference in it not melting well. This is so much better and I wouldn't do without it in my fridge.,influenster
7,I use this in just about everything I cook. I love the real butter taste. I'm a repeat customer who buys this all the time.,influenster
8,"I always use blue bonnet butter, every time I shop it goes right in my cart. From eggs to mashed potatoes and even chicken it works well in my recipes. I have gotten other brands in a pinch but in made my eggs taste funny. I will always buy it again and again.",influenster

10,We always buy Blue Bonnet. It has the best taste out of all of the other sticks. There is no sugar or cholesterol in Blue Bonnet and it is just as good as a stick of butter. It makes the BEST cookies. It is healthier than some of the other options. I will definitely continue to purchase Blue Bonnet. [product:blue-bonnet-vegetable-oil-spread],influenster
11,This happens to be my familys favorite so when I'm out of my other options I do use it. It has a decent flavor. I can taste that it's made with mainly vegetable oil. If you don't refrigerate it can separate. You need to mix it well and cool it back down.,influenster
12,This was a staple in my house growing up. I left it with the stick you can cut just as much as you need and that there’s markers on the stick.,influenster

15,It costs $1 for 5 bars of this in box. [user:walmart.] Cholesterol free which is good because mine is a bit on the higher side and it comes measured. So it’s easier no need for measuring utensils.,influenster

17,"This butter is creamy . I use for all my cooking. I love it on toast, mashed potatoes and my breakfast meals.",influenster

19,"I just try the Blue Bonnet Vegetable Oil Spread Margarine for the 1st time it is okay and taste a little different from the other margarine I have used. I found it to be kind of salty, but it has no Trans fat or Hydrogenated oil so that is good for me.",influenster
20,This is a great tub butter spread. It tastes really good and has been a go to for my family for years. We most frequently buy this variety but sometimes get the added calcium for the kids.,influenster

23,"I mainly use real butter but my spouse uses Smart Balance, my in-laws use I can't believe it's not butter. So I am used to using both real butter and vegetable spreads. Since money is tight at the moment and Blue Bonnet was on sale - I got that. It tasted perfectly fine on bagels, toast and pancakes and okay with making bread making salt adjustments (I usually use unsalted butter for making bread). It is definitely not butter and I probably wouldn't use it for making bread anymore but it's perfectly fine for spreading or topping pancakes/waffles.",influenster
